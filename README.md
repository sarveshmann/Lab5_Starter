Pt 3. Answers:
1) Yes, unit testing the "message" feature is advisable because it helps verify that the feature functions correctly in isolation. This includes testing whether the application allows users to write and send messages accurately and reliably.
2) Yes, using a unit test for the "max message length" feature is beneficial. This test would confirm that the application correctly limits message lengths to no more than 80 characters, ensuring the application behaves as expected under this constraint.
